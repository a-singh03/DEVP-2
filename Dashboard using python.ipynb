    "1. The data has been picked up from the *Amazon seller account of KHOJI* (a company selling virgin plastic planters). \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Descriptive variables__: The rows contain 93 unique SKU's of KHOJI, along with 93 unique Parent ASINs and titles. Further, the products are broadly divided into 5 classes:\n",

    "4. __Quantitative variables__: Following are the quantitaive variables which have been further bifurcated into B2B and normal customers \n",
    "\n",
    "     a. *Sessions*: The number of unique visitors to your product page\n",
    "\n",
    "     b. *Page Views*: Total number of times the product page was looked at (this can include multiple/repeat visits from the same people)\n",

    "\n",
    "     d. *Ordered product sales*: Total number of units sold\n",

    "     f. *Buy Box Percentage*: When a visitor landed on the product page, how often were the seller featured in the buy box (ADD TO CART)\n",

    "\n",
    "The above data suggests that Hanging Pots and Planters are the most popular and highest selling products among the Normal customers, while Water Can and Decorative Pots are the least popular and lowest selling products. \n",
    "This implies that the company should focus on increasing the sales of Hanging Pots and Planters by offering discounts, promotions, and other incentives. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, the company should find ways to increase the sales of the least popular products, such as Water Can and Decorative Pots, by making them more attractive to customers. \n",
    "Additionally, the company should consider diversifying its product offerings to meet the changing needs of customers.\n",
    "The company should consider analyzing customer data to identify customer preferences and tailor their marketing strategies accordingly. This will help them better understand their target audience and create products that meet their needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data suggests that there is a positive relationship between the number of sessions and page views and the number of units ordered and ordered product sales. This implies that the more people visit the website and view the pages, the more likely they are to purchase products. Therefore, managers should focus on increasing the number of sessions and page views in order to drive sales. To do this, they should focus on marketing and promotional strategies to attract more visitors and viewers to the website. Additionally, managers should ensure that the content is engaging to encourage visitors to stay and explore the seller's page.\n",

    "**b. B2B Customers**\n",
    "\n",
    "The above data suggests that B2B customers are mostly interested in Hanging Pots and Planters, as they have the highest numbers in terms of units ordered, sessions, page views, and ordered product sales. \n",
    "This could indicate that these two categories should be given priority when it comes to marketing and promotions. On the other hand, Water Cans and Decorative Pots have the lowest numbers in all categories and may need to be given more attention in order to increase their sales. \n",
    "\n",
    "Managers should analyze the data further to determine the reasons behind the variation in sales and take necessary steps to improve the sales of these categories. \n",
    "Additionally, they could identify various strategies to make the B2B customers more interested in these categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "The managerial implications from this analysis are that there is a clear positive relationship between units ordered of every category of the product and the page views total. This implies that managers should focus on increasing page views total in order to increase sales of their products. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, managers should pay attention to the different categories of the product and make sure that there is enough focus on each category to ensure that it is properly marketed and promoted in order to increase sales.\n",
    "Increasing the visibility of the product in the market will lead to an increase in the units ordered and ordered product sales.\n",
